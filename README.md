## Variables
---
*Variables* can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must *declare* it. Variables are declared with the keywords `const` or `let` .


`let studentName = 'Toby Keith';`

  `const schoolName = 'Code Immersives'`

  In JavaScript, there are two types of variable and also it tells you where in your program you are allowed to use the variables and functions that youâ€™ve defined.

**Local Variable**:

are variables that are defined *within* functions.

**Global Variable**:

global variables are variables that are defined *outside* of functions. they can be used by any function without passing them to the function as parameters.

**Parameters**

Function parameters are the names listed in the function.
