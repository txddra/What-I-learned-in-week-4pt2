# Week 4;

During this week, we went over a few things to include:
 - __Variables__ (*and how to declare them*)
 - __Strings__
 - __Scope__
 - __Booleans__

## Variables
---
*Variables* can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must *declare* it. Variables are declared with the keywords `const` or `let` .

`let studentName = 'Toby Keith';`

  `const schoolName = 'Code Immersives'`
